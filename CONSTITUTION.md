Structure
---------

The union is organized in three groups: the members in each workplace, the executive, and the committees.

### The members in each workplace

All union decisions in a workplace are made by the members in that workplace.

The members in each workplace may negotiate collectively on pay and conditions.

### The executive

The executive consists of the president and the secretary, who must be distinct members.

The president may resign by so writing to the union. The secretary may resign by so writing to the union. Any vacancy in the executive may be filled through a resolution. The executive may be replaced through a resolution.

### The committees

The electoral committee processes the votes for resolutions. Upon adoption of this constitution the electoral committee shall consist of all the members of the union at that time.

The membership committee, with the consent of the secretary, decides eligibility of applicants.

The president may establish other committees, consistent with the objectives and principles of the union. The president may appoint any member (except the president and the secretary) as a delegate to any committee and may remove any delegate from any committee.

A member ceases to be a delegate on any committees upon becoming the president or the secretary.

Any delegate may resign by so writing to the president.

All expenditures require the consent of the secretary.


Resolutions
-----------

Any member may propose a resolution by so writing to the union. Thereafter, for a period of one week, any member may propose alternative resolutions by so writing to the union.

All proposed resolutions (except those as to the composition of the executive) shall require the consent of the secretary. No proposed resolution may create an obligation on any member.

Thereafter, for a period of one week, any member may approve any number of the options (including a "none of the above" option) by so writing to the electoral committee.

Thereafter, within one week, the electoral committee shall declare the result. The option receiving the most approval (including the approval of at least fifteen members) shall be adopted, if any.

If the electoral committee fails to declare the result within one week then the executive shall be vacated and the electoral committee shall consist of all the members of the union at that time.


General
-------

This constitution shall be governed by the laws of New Zealand. In any legal dispute arising out of this constitution the courts of New Zealand shall have exclusive jurisdiction.
